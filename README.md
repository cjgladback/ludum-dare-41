## Entry for Ludum Dare 41
###### by CJ Gladback

This is a WIP Unity project and assets for a 48-72 hour game jam running from Friday April 20th to Monday April 23rd, 2018.

As any amount of base code is allowed to start ~~if I'm reading the rules right~~, there will be some experimentations saved here prior to the jam start.

I'll update the readme as I have time to clarify file organization and use.

###### Nothing here is professionally recommended or warrantied to work well; I am a beginner in game design, programming, AND source control, all of which I expect to show in shady decisions here. Feel free to talk to me on [ldjam.com](https://ldjam.com/users/cjgladback/) if you need something clarified after the jam is over.
