##Entry for Ludum Dare 41 by CJ Gladback

This is the WIP Unity project and assets for a 48-72 hour game jam running from Friday April 20th to Monday April 23rd, 2018.

As any amount of base code is allowed to start ~~if I'm reading the rules right~~, there will be some experimentations saved here prior to the jam start.

I'll update the readme as I have time to clarify file organization and use.

######Nothing here is professionally recommended or warranteed to work well; I am a beginner in game design, programming, AND source control, all of which I expect to show in shady decisions here. Feel free to comment if you need something clarified after the jam is over.
